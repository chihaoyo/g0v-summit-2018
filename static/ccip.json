Derek and the team along with partners across the globe are creating a digital public space constructed on the foundations of open source platforms. It currently operates at the intersection of open international government (policy) and digital government movements (technology) where organizations are working together to build the space - together.\n\nThe digital public space is a major step toward a more innovative and open way of identifying and co-creating programs, engagements, and research across the globe. It is designed for co-creation in all forms, but more importantly, it demonstrates the beginning of a cultural shift of horizontal governance and decision-making."}},{"id":"rec3HX7cWnuv9PakX","講者確認顯示名稱":"chihao & pm5 http://www.mgt.ncu.edu.tw/~ckfarn/doc/20100506GSS_Perry_talk.pdf","avatar":"https://dl.airtable.com/AcRwe2CfR6qqv0sMCYOw_full_44.jpg","zh":{"name":"張培鏞 ","bio":"社團法人台灣數位科技與政策協進會理事，叡揚資訊股份有限公司董事長。創立國內第一家 100% 營收以軟體及服務為業務之叡揚資訊公司，帶領團隊建立軟體工程機制及專案管理方法論，努力建立軟體、服務、知識有價之觀念，建構開拓國際市場的機制與組織，成功進入大陸及日本市場。"},"en":{"name":"Perry Chang","bio":"社團法人台灣數位科技與政策協進會理事，叡揚資訊股份有限公司董事長。創立國內第一家 100% 營收以軟體及服務為業務之叡揚資訊公司，帶領團隊建立軟體工程機制及專案管理方法論，努力建立軟體、服務、知識有價之觀念，建構開拓國際市場的機制與組織，成功進入大陸及日本市場。"}}]},{"id":"recahxnefdMG7walN","TRACK_TMP":["recTasyLGUwI4hwXh"],"room":"R1","start":"2018-10-07T05:30:00.000Z","end":"2018-10-07T05:50:00.000Z","type":"talk","zh":{"subject":"開發中的東南亞：把開放資料帶進社區【譯】","summary":"Open Development Cambodia (ODC) collates and publishes data from a wide range of sources that was previously difficult to find.
